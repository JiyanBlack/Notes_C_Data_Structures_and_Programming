1. Source code: sumRange.c
2. Source code --> Preprocessor cpp --> preprocessed c code(gcc -E code.c) , including:
  * paste the code from header files before the current code;
  * delete all comments;
  * Other tricks like macros;
3. Preprocessed code --> compiler gcc --> program.s(gcc -s code.c) which is the assembly code--human readable machine code
4. assembly code --> assembler(as) --> program.o (machine code) which is not readable, almost complete but missing 
memory addresses for functions and variables
5. machine code --> linker ld with system library --> program.exe(executable file)
